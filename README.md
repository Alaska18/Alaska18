## Naber? Sup Dudess!
I like being called a polymath and Walker and swifty
can say that I have given my love senses to 1D
they are pure love!

Also also I just love learning about algorithms and bits and bytes of entire computer systems.
Also I am multilingual, I can speak Turkish, korean and Taiwannese apart from English, Hindi and Telugu.
